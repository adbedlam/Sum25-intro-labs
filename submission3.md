### TASK 1

#### Key Concepts

- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub that automates workflows like testing, building, and deploying code.
- **Workflow**: Defined in `.github/workflows/` using YAML. It's a set of steps that GitHub executes.
- **Runners**: Virtual machines or containers that run workflows.
- **Triggers**: Events that start workflows (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`).
